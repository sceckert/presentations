# Classifying & Classification



## Agenda

- Classification and Its Consequences
	- Geoffrey Bowker and Susan Leigh Star, Ch.1 and Ch. 2 from *Sorting Things Out: Classification and Its Consequences* (1999)
	- What do classifications do?
	- Classifications as ubiquituous
	- Classifications as material
	- Classification as practical politics
- Imagining Classifications
	- Marisa Elena Duarte and Miranda Belarde-Lewis, "Imagining: Creating Space for Indigenous Ontologies" (2015)
	- The limits of text-based classification systems?
	- Who's doing the classifying?
	- The ethics of classification
- Preparing for practicum on Thursday



## When Classifications Break

- Think of a moment when you experienced a classification system break down or not working the way it should. 

	- What did you notice? 
	- What was it like?


> "Once a system is in place, the practical politics of these decisions are often forgotten" (45). 

But how invisible are classifications systems?

- Grace asked: Can we think of some examples of classification systems that we actually do take for granted?
- Sophie asked: What features might make a classification system more or less visible?




## Classification and Its Consequences>"A classification is a spatial, temporal, or spatio-temporal segmentation of the world." (Bowker and Star 10)

> A classification is an "infrastructure," part of the "built information environment" (Bowker and Star 5)

> "In the everyday sense, the power to name is a way of organizing, of itemizing, of making information and knowledge accessible to both a specific and imaginary constituent audience" (Duarte and Belarde-Lewis 681)


In the most abstract sense, a classification system exhibits the following properties:

1. It has **consistent**, **unique** classificatory principles
2. The categories are mutually exclusive
3. The system is **complete**

BUT NO REAL WORLD CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM LOOKS LIKE THIS!! <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->


## Can a classification be complete, consistent, unique?

Grant asked: *is* there such a thing as there is a best classification scheme for a given task?

Jose Pablo asked: is there anything left that hasn’t been classified or standardized, and does something being deemed non-classified or nonstandard actually make it fall within these structures?


How should we analyze classifications? (And why should we care?)


Some "tricks of the trade" for analyzing classifications:

1. Classifications as ***ubiquitous*** (and none of them stand alone––all part of vast, layered, tangled systems of interlinking classifications and standards)

2. Classifications as ***material***

3. Classifications ***shift historically*** (and classifications from the past are often filtered through categories of the present)

4. Classifications and standards have ***practical politics***

(From Bowker and Star, Ch. 1)


## But are the politics of classification really so easily forgotten?

- Grace asked: Can we think of some examples of classification systems that we actually do take for granted?
- Sophie asked: What features might make a classification system more or less visible?


### Classification as material

- Austin: but is that exactly the same thing as "texture," as Bowker and Leigh use it? 
- What does it mean to think of a classification system as "material"?


### Classification as practical politics

- José Pablo: What does it mean to treat things like economics or, in this case, classification and standardization as scientific or fact-based things separate from politics and society? How does it hinder or strengthen ourunderstanding and the use of these practices?



## Imagining Classifications

Marisa Elena Duarte and Miranda Belarde-Lewis on the categorization of "Native American" materials in museums, libraries, and archives.


Epistemology: *a fancy word for "ways of knowing"* <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

Ontology: *a framework for representing information. Ontology (in the narrower context of information science) has to do with the naming and categorizing of things, concepts, data, as well as the relationship between those categories.* <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->


What are some of the consequences of classification, according Duarte and Belarde-Lewis?


What does "decolonizing" mean for knowledge infrastructures?


## The limits of text-based ways of classifying knowledge:

- Kai: is it "possible to catalog information digitally without subscribing to a text based system"?
- Joshua: What would many of our systems that were made pre-computer look like (measurements & weights, book organization, course organization & selection) if they were made after computers were built?
- Hien asked: How can the current computing infrastructure be crafted to be more robust to datagathering i.e. we can store text, visual & audio data very well, what about taste & smell, orother sorts of data that isn't common in Western cullture?


## Who's doing the classifying?

- Amber: 
	- Who is best qualified to determine how to manage these infrastructural revolutions equitably if given the chance?
- Amber: Has the growth of technology contributed to the democratization of knowledge or is does the opportunity for technology more deeply ingratiate segregation? (I am thinking specifically about the use of Facebook for inter-tribe communication, the unapologetic lack of accommodation by the Western library, and the dichotomy between exclusion and forced assimilation in indigenous history.)


## Language:

- Grace: However, I was left wondering if language is the biggest and most influential classification system that would need to be decolonized in order to do this? How could language itself influences organization structures and ways of thinking and how does one "decolonize" it?
	- Grant: Would different classification schemes would've evolved if English wasn't the primary language in the culture that first created these data storage mechanisms?


| Brian Deer system at Xwi7xwa Library | Library of Congress |
| --- | --- |
| uses First Nations names | uses European names assigned by anthropologists |
| uses terminology for First Nations concepts, like self-government | uses standard LoC terms |
|  Books on **Tsimshian** (a nation located along the Nass and Skeena Rivers in the Northern coast of British Columbia in Canada), are organized next to Nisga'a, its neighbor to the north |  Books on **Tsimshian** (a nation located along the Nass and Skeena Rivers in the Northern coast of British Columbia in Canada) organized next to alphabetical successor, the Tubatulabal (a people in Central California/Nevada) |


## The ethics of classification

- Hien: How can classification be applied and documented in a way that isn't deleterious to thespecificities of what we're classifying?
