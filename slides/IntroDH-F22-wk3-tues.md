# Classifying & Classification



## Agenda

- Classification and Its Consequences
	- Geoffrey Bowker and Susan Leigh Star, Ch.1 and Ch. 2 from *Sorting Things Out: Classification and Its Consequences* (1999)
	- What do classifications do?
	- Classifications as ubiquituous
	- Classifications as material
	- Classification as practical politics & naming
- Imagining Classifications
	- Marisa Elena Duarte and Miranda Belarde-Lewis, "Imagining: Creating Space for Indigenous Ontologies" (2015)
	- Is it possible to "imagine" other ways of knowing in dominant systems?
	- Who's doing the classifying?
	- The ethics of classification
- Preparing for practicum on Thursday

Note:
- Borrowing NOAH's description “how we structure our knowledge shows who,what, and how we can know” (Duarte 684).



## When Classifications Break

- Think of a moment when you experienced a classification system break down or not working the way it should. 

	- What did you notice? 
	- What was it like?


> "Once a system is in place, the practical politics of these decisions are often forgotten" (45). 

- Can we think of some examples of classification systems that we take for granted?


## Classification and Its Consequences

>"A classification is a spatial, temporal, or spatio-temporal segmentation of the world." (Bowker and Star 10)

> A classification is an "infrastructure," part of the "built information environment" (Bowker and Star 5)

> "In the everyday sense, the power to name is a way of organizing, of itemizing, of making information and knowledge accessible to both a specific and imaginary constituent audience" (Duarte and Belarde-Lewis 681)



## What *IS* a classification? 

- CECILIA pointed out a connection between classification and naming: 
- NOAH: “how we structure our knowledge shows who,what, and how we can know” (Duarte 684).


In the most abstract sense, a classification system exhibits the following properties:

1. It has **consistent**, **unique** classificatory principles
2. The categories are mutually exclusive
3. The system is **complete**

BUT NO REAL WORLD CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM LOOKS LIKE THIS!! <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->



### How invisible are classifications? 

What do Bowker and Star mean when they say infrastructures "disappear"

- Hazel asked:  What are the consequences of a technological history of erasure of failure. As the articledescribes, "This inversion is a struggle against the tendency of infrastructure to disappear."What exactly does this mean? Perhaps that this failed infrastructure is untraceable?



## What makes a "good" classification? Can a classification be complete, consistent, unique?

 *Is* there such a thing as there is a best classification scheme for a given task? (Think back to the example that Bowker and Star give  on page 69)

- CECILIA asked: How do you balance efficiency with accuracy - does it depend on the field? For instance, should medical professionals be forced to adapt and spend longer utilizing systems they didn’t create, or should the creators of such systems serve the user (ex. listening to epistemological methods of Indigenous people in Duarte and Belarde-Lewis’s article)?

- How should we analyze classifications? (And why should we care?)






## Some "tricks of the trade" for analyzing classifications:

1. Classifications as ***ubiquitous*** (and none of them stand alone––all part of vast, layered, tangled systems of interlinking classifications and standards)

2. Classifications as ***material***

3. Classifications ***shift historically*** (and classifications from the past are often filtered through categories of the present)

4. Classifications and standards have ***practical politics***

(From Bowker and Star, Ch. 1)



## How do we avoid being "blind" forgotten?


-  What features might make a classification system more or less visible?
- SIMEEL asked: How do we avoid being the "blind" actors when it comes to our classification systems?

Note:
Simeel brought up the example from Bowker and Star ?



### How we "read" classification 

- Cecilia:  In what ways could the systems be improved? Whose voices should be considered?


- MIKALA asked Is there a way we can make the standards and categorizations discussed by Bowker & Star less invisiblewithout needing to spend 56 pages dissecting it, as they did the ICD?

- LOIS asked:  is itpossible to ever have knowledge systems or standards that are completely transparent inshowing embedded forms of power?





## Imagining Classifications

Marisa Elena Duarte and Miranda Belarde-Lewis on the categorization of "Native American" materials in museums, libraries, and archives.


Epistemology: *a fancy word for "ways of knowing"* <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

Ontology: *a framework for representing information. Ontology (in the narrower context of information science) has to do with the naming and categorizing of things, concepts, data, as well as the relationship between those categories.* <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->


What are some of the consequences of classification, according Duarte and Belarde-Lewis?


- CECILIA asks: How does naming function in providing legitimacy, respect, and ease of accessibility to Indigenous materials? Are there inherent shortcomings of any name - what should be prioritized


## "Specificity leads to Universality" 


- ANIKA: Duarte & Belarde-Lewis quote Manulani Aluli-Meyer'sassertion that "specificity leads to universality" (p. 678). -- how might these methodological imaginaries be able to coexist with the rigid, top-down infrastucture of the early operating systems we have looked at in class thus far?
- WILL: Does carving out distinct systems of knowledge lead to modularity?  Does specificity meanthe same thing as modularity?"
- GRADY:  How can we relate the idea ofIndigenous archiving to that of lenticularity and modularity?


## Is it possible to "imagine other ontologies" within dominant systems?

- Hope:  how we can work to reorganize existingdata that has been inaccurately labeled or categorized. Furthermore, how can we ensure thatthis reorganization honors the history of Indigenous people without accidentally creatingconfusion within research fields.?

- FAITH: To what extent is is possible to work outside dominant classifying systems?

Note:
- What 


## Who's doing the classifying?

- HARRY: is it possible to see classifications and naming through a non-colonialist mindset if one is not Indigenous, and how can those with deep domain knowledge in system design begin to classify, catalogue and name without having experienced first hand some of the things they are cataloguing
