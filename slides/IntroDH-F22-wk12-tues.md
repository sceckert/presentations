## Housekeeping:



### Presentations
- Each of your presentations should aim for 7-9 minutes (with a hard cap of 10 minutes), with 5 minutes of feedback
- Please arrive on time! (We  have a lot of presentations to get through)
- Reminder: see outlines for criteria here: https://github.com/sceckert/IntroDHFall2022/blob/main/_assignments/final-project-presentations.md



### Final Project Reflection papers:
DUE: Dean's Date

Link: https://github.com/sceckert/IntroDHFall2022/blob/main/_assignments/final-project-assignment-prompt.md

 What you will turn in for the final project:


For your **final project reflection paper,** you'll turn in your **project files** (eg. dataset, Jupyter notebook, link to a GitHub repository, etc) and a **paper** (min. 4-5 pages, maximum 15 pages) to accompany your project.

For the **project files,** you should plan to turn in a **Jupyter notebook**(or link to a GitHub repo with a Jupyter notebook) along with any relevant data files.  If you feel that a Jupyter notebook is not the best way to represent or carry out your project you should talk with me. about alternatives. The project files should be collaborative, but each of you will write your own reflection paper.

In this **paper**, you might discuss:
-  the argument you've developed about your findings
-  the finalized state of your project (including relevant visualizations or analysis)
- your final findings  (incorporate feedback from today's presentation)
- An argument about what you found. 
	- This can be about the data of your project. Or it can take the form of an argument about the methods you used
- Any final reflections on the next stages of the process.



### Course Reflection 

We'll have TWO forms of reflection/evaluation: 

1) the official course evaluation (this is external: for registrar, other students, for instructor job portfolios)
2) our own course reflection (this is where I'll ask for feedback on particular course readings, assignments, structure -- this is more INTERNAL for me)

Each serve different purposes and I would SO appreciate it if you could take time to fill both out. 



### Posner, "The Radical, Unrealized Potential of Digital Humanities" 

Two passages to jumpstart our discussion: <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->


"For all of its vaunted innovation, the digital humanities actuallyborrows a lot of its infrastructure, data models, and visual rhetoric from other areas, and particularly from modelsdeveloped for business applications. In some ways, that is inevitable, because the business market is just so muchbigger, and so much better funded, than the market for weird, boutique humanities tools." <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

Miriam Posner, "What's Next: The Radical, Unrealized Potential of Digital Humanities"(Paragraph 4) <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->


"We can do what we know howto do: visualize datasets that we inherit from governments, corporations, and cultural institutions, using tools thatwe have borrowed from corporations. Or we can scrutinize data, rip it apart, rebuild it, reimagine it, and perhapsbuild something entirely different and weirder and more ambitious."

Miriam Posner, "What's Next: The Radical, Unrealized Potential of Digital Humanities (halfway down the page, just before the "Changing the Composition of the Archive" section)


"Perhaps those of us who are interested in seeing more robust cultural critique need to be more specific aboutwhere the intervention might most productively take place. It is not only about shifting the focus of projects sothat they feature marginalized communities more prominently; it is about ripping apart and rebuilding themachinery of the archive and database so that it does not reproduce the logic that got us here in the first place.The great value of teaching DH to undergrads, I have come to believe, is not showing them how to use newtechnology, but showing them how provisional, relative, and profoundly ideological is the world beingconstructed all around us with data. It is an opportunity to show them that our most apparently universalcategories—man/woman, black/white—are not inevitable, but the result of very specific power arrangements.Data visualizations, maps, and spreadsheets look terrifyingly authoritative to a nineteen-year-old—and to us, too.One great value of rigorous critical inquiry is that you can help people see how this was all constructed, and towhat ideological ends" 


Note:
- How would we characterize Miriam Posner's vision of DH?
- Posner talks about DH BORROWING its inffrastructure and tools developed from industry  
- Were there other passages that stood out to you all?
- M.P. describes what she sees as the value of "teaching DH to Undergrads" 
- At the end of the essay, she turns to cinema studies  do we think she ends by talking about cinema studies?



#### PROJECT CLINIC

Get together with your group members:

+ What work remains to be done?
+ Are there any lingering issues?
+ What's in scope for Thursday? For the final project paper?
+ How will you divide up the labor of the presentation?



### Good luck!
