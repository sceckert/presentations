## What *is* Data in Literary Studies?

- data  |  datum  —  to give  |  rhetorical <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
-  fact  |  facere  —  to do  |  ontological <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- evidence  |  videre  —  to see  |  epistemological <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->

> “…the meaning of data must always shift with argumentative strategy and context—and with the history of both.” <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->

## What does data have to do with the study of literature?

- Rickert's *New Methods for the Study of Literature* (1927) <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
- Waberski code ![image](../images/waberski-cipher.jpg) <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->


## Rickert's Method 

"On the hypothesis, then, that the soul of literature is inseparable from style, which is its body, the general method in this book is to analyze the complex of style into its several strands, which may be called Imagery, Words,  Thought Patterns, Rhythm, Tone Patterns, and—what is  often disregarded—Visual Devices; and for each of these to find graphical and statistical methods by which its varied manifestations in different pieces of writing may be— understood with a definiteness and a certainty impossible through reading alone." (7)

- What stood out to you when you read Rickert's analysis?
- What can we gain from studying a work of literature this way? What do we lose?


## Rickert's method

> The sky was a miracle of purity, a miracle of azure. The sea was polished, was blue, was pellucid, was sparkling like a precious stone, extending on all sides, all round to the horizon—as if the whole terrestrial globe had been one jewel, one colossal sapphire, a single gem fashioned into a planet.
> ––Joseph Conrad, *Youth* (1910)

> Every day and all day the same pale-blue sky and the unwinking sun over the moving speck. Every day and all day the same black-blue water world untouched by any known wind, smooth as a slab of syenite, colourful as an opal, stretched out and around and beyond and before and behind us, forever, illimitable, empty.
>–––Frank Norris, “The Ship That Saw a Ghost,” A Deal in Wheat (1903)
