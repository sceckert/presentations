# Week 10



## Agenda
- What is humanities data visualization?
- Discussion of Data Visualization and methods
- Exercise: review what we've learned so far in data visualization



## Data vs. Capta

- What does Joanna Drucker when she distinguishes "data" and "capta"? What's the difference between the two terms? Do we agree?


"Capta is “taken” actively while data is assumed to be a “given”able to be recorded and observed. From this distinction, a world ofdifferences arises. Humanistic inquiry acknowledges the situated,partial, and constitutive character of knowledge production, therecognition that knowledge is constructed, taken, not simply givenas a natural representation of pre-existing fact." (Drucker)



### Drucker, Humanities Approaches to Graphical Design

What were some of the issues in this kind of chart?

What are the differences between these charts?

What are the differences between these charts? How does this relate to the concept of knowledge as "observer-independent" vs. knowledge as observer co-dependent?

- How do Lupi and Drucker compare? (How is Lupi's data "humanism" different from Drucker's?)
- How do each of them handle uncertainty and ambiguity in data visualization?
- It seemed like you all saw difference in the way Lupi and Drucker handled complexity?

Note: 
 - Can all data be represented in this more fluid/abstract style? Does introducing visual ambiguity create the risk of a different type of visual misinterpretation of the ambiguity itself? (SOPHIE)
- Does adding more data and context really aid in humanistic Interpretation( GRANT)
- What would it look like to create a "parallax" view (HIEN)
- Could we think about alternative techniques for visualizing these questions?
	- What about techniques for visualizing undertaintiy and ambiguity? 
	- Some of you brought up the question of CLARITY, and I was really interested in this. Do we think there are issues that come up in trying to visualize complexity? (GRACE, HIEN)



## Data Visualization and Methods

In groups, discuss the visualization choices in one of the following:

- Preservation of Favoured Traces (https://fathom.info/traces/)
- Wind Map (http://hint.fm/wind/)
- Dear Data (https://www.dear-data.com/theproject)
