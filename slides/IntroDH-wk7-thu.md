##  Week 7: Practicum

## AGENDA

- Computational check-in
-  In-class assignment with Pandas and *The Pudding* data
-  Final Project ideas Workshop
- Discuss DH methods with DHRoopika Risam's "Digital postcolonial record"



## Computational check-in

- What questions do you have about methods we've learned so far? 


- Jupyter notebooks review: are you able to open and create Jupiter notebooks?
- Pandas review: what lingering questions do you have?
	- `Groupby()` , merging, and plots
	- New: 
		- Making new data frames from calculations on existing data
		- Making scatter plots



###  Hunches, Hypotheses, and Exploratory Data Analysis: Part II

Open up the Jupyter notebooks (via Anaconda Navigator) that you started for Homework for Week 7.


Working together, write code in your Jupyter notebooks that would allow us to answer the following questions: 

1. How could we tell if the amount of dialogue (by gender breakdown and total), was increasing over time in movies? How might this influence the assessment about the breakdown of gender dialogue?
2. How could you test if there was any relationship between the film's gross value and the amount of dialogue in the film?
3. How would you visualize one of the research questions above?  (*We'll also go over this together*)

Finally, briefly discuss what other research questions would you want to explore in this dataset?

### Reconvene & Discuss 


1. What did you find?
2. What other research questions would you want to explore in this dataset?

Bonus: How could we visualize these findings?


##  Final project ideas workshop

Take a minute to write down your ideas for final projects: https://bit.ly/2OYSMzT

Read over your classmates' ideas

Click on the "breakout rooms" menu, pop into one of the five open breakout room and take turns sharing and worshiping your project ideas.

- What's the research question?
- What data would you be working with?
- What kind of methods you be using? 
- Is the scope feasible?


## Discussing our methods 

For today, you read two pieces. One by Katie Rawson and Trevor Muñoz about data cleaning, the other, by Roopika Risam

- Do we think that humanists should clean their data? What are the consequences if they do, or if they don't?
- What do we think Roopika Risam means when she says "As a result, the digital cultural record is in danger of telling the story of humanity from the perspective of the Global North alone."
- Can we think of examples?


Note:
I assigned Roopika Risam's introduction to the book project, because I thought we could talk a little bit about what the. I actually wish I had assigned us Chapter 5 to read, because in it she talks in more concrete terms about how we can analyze digital artifacts like algorithms can encode ideas about the HUMAN in human writing.
