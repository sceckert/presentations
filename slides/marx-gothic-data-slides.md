The social statistics of Germany and the rest of Continental Western Europe, are, in comparison with those of England, quite wretched. But they raise the veil just enough to let us catch <span class="fragment highlight-red">a glimpse of the Medusa’s head behind it.</span>  <span class="fragment">We should be appalled at our own circumstances, if, as in England, our governments and parliaments periodically appointed commissions of inquiry into economic conditions; if these commissions were armed with the same plenary powers to get at the truth; if it was possible to find for this purpose men as competent, as free from partisanship and respect of persons as are England's factory-inspectors, her medical reporters on public health, her commissioners of inquiry into the exploitation of women and children, into the conditions of housing and nourishment, and so on.  <span class="fragment highlight-red">Perseus wore a magic cap so that the monsters he hunted down might not see him. We draw the magic cap down over our own eyes and ears so as to deny that there are any monsters. (91) </span> </span>
