"Paradox of exposure"(pg 9) <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

"Administrative violence" (pg. 11)<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->

"Matrix of domination" (pg 11) <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->


Even the idea of gender "perforative" (D'Ignazio & Klein, quoting Judith Butler) "still reinforce the *categories* of gender" (pg. 11)

The ethical complexity of whether to count gender, when to count gender, and how to count gender illuminates the complexity of acts of classification against the backdrop of structural oppression. Because when it comes to data collection, and the categories that structure it, there are power imbalances up and down, side to side, and everywhere in between." (pg. 15 in PDF) <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->

"Flawed classification systems" can be read as "symptoms of a more global condition of inequality. " (D'Ignazio and Klein 106)



- What does a category or classification system tell us about INDIVIDUALS? (Very little )
- What does a category or classification system tell us about SYSTEMS? 

- What are the things––sometimes strange things–– that result from modes of collection?  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
- What do they tell us about the modes of collection? <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- What implications does this have?  <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
