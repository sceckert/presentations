## Analog, Digital
**John Haugland, "Analog and Analog" (1981)**

Examples of "digital devices"": Arabic numerals, abacuses, alphabets, electrical switches, musical notation, poker chips and (digital) computers.


"All digital devices involve some form of *writing* and then *reading*..."  
(Haugland 214) <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

“the write procedure produce a token and the read procedure correctly identify that token” (Haugland 215 )<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->



### The Materiality of Information

"The information we want to represent is intimately linked to how it is stored. We can no longer separate the two." 
-- Aditya Mukerjee, "I Can Text You A Pile of Poo, But I Can’t Write My Name"



## Universal Language

### Materiality of the Web

Jill Lepore's "The Cobweb" (2015), talking about  Brewster Kahle (creator of the Internet Archive)

> "When I met him, I was struck by a story he told abouthow he once put the entire World Wide Web into a shipping container. He just wantedto see if it would fit. How big is the Web? It turns out, he said, that it’s twenty feet byeight feet by eight feet, or, at least, it was on the day he measured it. How much did itweigh? Twenty-six thousand pounds. He thought that meant something. He thoughtpeople needed to know that."



### Medium, Mode, Message

## Where does materiality stop?
#### From Scott Weingart's "The Route of a Text Message"
"In displaying everything but my wife’s text message, and letting me read it in the gaps, my phone succinctly betrays the lie at the heart of the information age: that communication is simple. **Speed and ease hide a mountain of mediation**."

"And that mediation isn’t just technical. My wife’s text wouldn’t have reached me had I not paid the phone bill on time, had there not been a small army of workers handling financial systems behind the scenes. Technicians keep the phone towers in working order, which they reach via a network of roads partially subsidized by federal taxes collected from hundreds of millions of Americans across 50 states. Because so many transactions still occur via mail, if the U.S. postal system collapsed tomorrow, my phone service would falter. Exploited factory workers in South America and Asia assembled parts in both our phones, and exhausted programmers renting expensive Silicon Valley closets are as-you-read-this pushing out code ensuring our phones communicate without interruption."
