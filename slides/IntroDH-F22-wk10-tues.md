# Week 10
## A humanities approach to graphs, maps, and charts



## Agenda
- What is humanities data visualization?
	- What does it mean to visualize data "critically"? (Three approaches)
- Discussion of data visualization and methods
- Exercise: review what we've learned so far in data visualization



## Data vs. Capta

- What does Joanna Drucker when she distinguishes "data" and "capta"? What's the difference between the two terms? Do we agree?


"Capta is “taken” actively while data is assumed to be a “given”
able to be recorded and observed. From this distinction, a world of
differences arises. Humanistic inquiry acknowledges the situated,
partial, and constitutive character of knowledge production, the
recognition that knowledge is constructed, taken, not simply given
as a natural representation of pre-existing fact." (Drucker)

Note:
What are the underlying assumptions baked into this visualization of population statistics of men and women in various countries (A-F)?

Note:
How does this chart compare?


What are the differences between these charts?

What are the differences between these charts? How does this relate to the concept of knowledge as "observer-independent" vs. knowledge as observer co-dependent?

#### Drucker's "Humanities Approaches to Graphical Display"
#### & Lupi's "Data Humanism"
-  What does "critical" data visualization look like for each of them? How do Lupi and Drucker compare? (How is Lupi's data "humanism" different from Drucker's?)
- What did we make of each of their approaches?
- Are there drawbacks to Lupi's call to embrace "complexity" (or Drucker's situated vsiaulaizaitons)

Note: 
- When might we NOT want to make a complex visualization (SIMEEL)
- Should data visualizations be EASY or STREAMLINED?  Intuitive to Read
- What's at stake in "simple" vs complex visualizations"
- Hope, "PEAK INFOGRPHAICS: "false claim that ta couple of pictograms and a few big numbers have the innate power to simplify complexity" (Luip 3)
- Concept of "counter visualization" -- need to engage with the social ct of producing data 
- What are examples of Visualizing this compelxit(Grady)

In groups, discuss the visualization choices in one of the following:

- Preservation of Favoured Traces (https://fathom.info/traces/)
- Wind Map (http://hint.fm/wind/)
- Dear Data (https://www.dear-data.com/theproject)
- W.E.B. DuBois's data Visualizations for the 1900 World Expo (https://tinyurl.com/yeywxj63)



## Beyond the Data Visualization

All data visualizations are exercises in making data *sensible* -- that is, they are rhetorical devices that make legible patterns of different and similarity. 

What if we considered other senses beyond vision for communicating and representing data?<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
