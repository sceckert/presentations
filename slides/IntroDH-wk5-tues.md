DH Project Critique
Due 3/11 2-3 pages

- Format of your DH project review: (based on  *Reviews in DH*)
	- a brief summary of the project and its purpose
	- an assessment of the humanistic claims and evidence
	- an assessment of the technology used/developed
	- an assessment of the project methods (what are their sources, processing methods, presentation methods? How is this information documented or shared? Who is involved in the project?)
	- an evaluation of the project: how does it achieve its goals (ex, engaging new audience, offer a new methodology for comparative literature, creating a new datasetâ€“here you'll want to think about the project on its own terms)
	- a discussion of interesting, outstanding or problematic issues in the project
